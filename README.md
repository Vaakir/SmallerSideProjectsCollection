# SmallerSideProjectsCollection

A collection of what I do when I am bored. 
I unfortunately couldn't share a lot of my work on game hacking (I think I went past the gray zone) nor quant trading (timing based systems) and especially quant investing (comparison based systems) (alpha decay, need I say more).
